  Welcome to my homepage! 
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm Huizai YAO, currently a Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Hui Xiong</a> 
  at the AI Thrust, Information Hub, HKUST(GZ). 
  I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Nankai University. 
  During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research intern at BNRist, Tsinghua University, supervised by 
  Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/schzhao" target="_blank">Sicheng Zhao</a>, 
  and also as a trainee researcher at Shanghai AI Lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’m broadly interested in building vision and language systems that can understand, adapt, and generalize to real-world dynamics.

  I play
